# Study.io - Status Report & Demo Summary

## Demo Summary

The demo will showcase a flashcard-based study application that demonstrates both real and simulated functionality. The real components include a complete user authentication flow with login and signup screens, seamless navigation between different application screens, and a class selection interface that allows users to browse their enrolled courses. The application's architecture is fully implemented using modern Android development practices, including a Room database for local data persistence, Hilt dependency injection for clean component management, and a Repository pattern that provides a clean abstraction layer between the UI and data sources.

The demo flow begins with a home screen presenting login and signup options, where the login functionality is currently bypassed for demonstration purposes to directly access the main interface. Users can then navigate to a class selection screen that displays available courses including ECE493A, ECE498, ECE452, MSE446, and EARTH121. Upon selecting a class, users are taken to a selected class screen that shows deck management capabilities, currently displaying a placeholder card list. The application also demonstrates database operations for creating and managing study decks, showcasing the complete data flow from UI interaction to local storage.

## Current Progress

Our study.io application has made significant progress in establishing a solid foundation for a flashcard-based learning platform. The Android project has been successfully set up using Jetpack Compose and Material 3, providing a modern and responsive user interface framework. The navigation system has been implemented using Navigation Compose, enabling smooth transitions between different screens and maintaining proper back stack management.

The data layer has been thoroughly implemented with a Room database setup that includes Deck and ReviewCards entities. These entities are properly annotated with Room annotations and include foreign key relationships to maintain data integrity. The Repository pattern has been implemented with a DAO layer that provides clean abstractions for database operations, allowing the business logic to remain separate from data access concerns.

Dependency injection has been configured using Hilt, which simplifies component management and improves testability. The application follows the MVVM architecture pattern with ViewModels that manage UI state and handle business logic. The database schema has been designed with proper relationships, ensuring that decks can contain multiple review cards while maintaining referential integrity.

Currently, we have implemented basic UI screens including Home, Login, Signup, LoggedIn, and SelectedClass screens. These screens provide the foundation for user interaction and demonstrate the application's navigation capabilities. The ViewModel architecture is in place with state management that allows for reactive UI updates based on data changes.

## Design Choices and Architecture

The decision to use Jetpack Compose was driven by its declarative nature and ability to create complex UIs with less code compared to traditional View-based approaches. Compose provides better performance and easier state management, which is crucial for a study application that needs to handle frequent UI updates during flashcard review sessions.

The choice of Room database over other local storage solutions was based on its seamless integration with Android's architecture components and its ability to provide compile-time verification of SQL queries. Room's annotation-based approach reduces boilerplate code and helps prevent runtime errors, making it ideal for managing complex data relationships between decks and review cards.

Hilt was selected for dependency injection because it provides compile-time verification of dependencies and integrates well with Android's lifecycle management. This choice simplifies testing and makes the codebase more maintainable by clearly defining component dependencies and their scopes.

The Repository pattern was implemented to provide a clean abstraction layer between the data sources and the business logic. This design choice allows for easy switching between different data sources (local database, remote API, etc.) without affecting the UI layer. The pattern also centralizes data access logic and makes the application more testable.

The MVVM architecture was chosen for its clear separation of concerns and its alignment with Android's recommended architecture patterns. ViewModels handle UI state management and business logic, while the UI components focus solely on presentation. This separation makes the code more maintainable and testable.

## Current Difficulties

One of the primary challenges we're facing is the integration of a proper user authentication system. Currently, the application uses placeholder data for demonstration purposes, but implementing a robust authentication system that can handle user registration, login, and session management requires careful consideration of security best practices and integration with backend services.

The implementation of flashcard review logic and spaced repetition algorithms presents another significant challenge. These algorithms need to be carefully designed to provide effective learning outcomes while maintaining good performance. The spaced repetition system must track user performance, calculate optimal review intervals, and adapt to individual learning patterns.

UI/UX polish is an ongoing challenge as we strive to create an intuitive and engaging user experience. The current interface provides basic functionality but needs refinement in terms of visual design, animations, and user interaction patterns. Creating a study application that motivates users to maintain consistent study habits requires thoughtful design decisions.

Data persistence and migration strategies need to be carefully planned to ensure that user data remains intact across application updates. This includes handling database schema changes, data migration, and backup/restore functionality. The current implementation provides basic data storage, but more sophisticated data management features are needed.

Testing presents another challenge as we need to develop comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure application reliability. The current codebase lacks extensive testing, which could lead to issues as the application grows in complexity. Implementing proper testing strategies for both UI components and business logic is essential for maintaining code quality.
